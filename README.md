This repository contains the metadata of the FAIR4Health project which was generated during the FAIRification processes of the clinical partners. 

According to the [FAIR4Health Common Data Model](https://github.com/fair4health/common-data-model/tree/master/onfhir.io/conf), the FAIRification process results in FAIRified datasets which are managed by an [onFHIR Repository](https://onfhir.io/). FAIR4Health Common Data Model utilizes the profiling approach of HL7 FHIR to ensure a satisfactory level of FAIR principles for health research datasets. 

Each clinical partner of the FAIR4Health project applied the FAIRification Workflow using the FAIR4Health software and the associated metadata was generated automatically at each onFHIR repository. Under each folder, the respective data owner's metadata is presented with FHIR's [DocumentManifest](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/documentmanifest.html) and [Provenance](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/provenance.html) resources.
